## What are Webhook Events?

Webhook events are notifications sent by GitHub to a specified URL when certain actions occur in your repository. These actions can include commits, pull requests, issues, and more. By configuring webhook events, you can automate notifications and integrate GitHub activities with external services like Discord.

## Why Use Octohooks for Webhook Events?

Octohooks makes it easy to integrate GitHub webhook events with your Discord server. With Octohooks, you can:

- **Receive Real-Time Notifications**: Get instant updates on GitHub activities in your Discord channels.
- **Customize Event Modifiers**: Tailor notifications to your needs with advanced event modifiers and filters.
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Keep your team informed and improve collaboration with automated notifications.

## How to Use Supported Events

To use supported events with Octohooks, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Webhook**: Use the `/newhook` command to create a new webhook in your Discord server.
2. **Set Up the Webhook in GitHub**: Add the webhook URL provided by Octohooks to your GitHub repository's webhook settings. Select the events you want to receive notifications for.
3. **Configure Event Modifiers**: Use the `/eventmod create` command to create event modifiers for the selected events. This allows you to customize how the events are handled and displayed in your Discord channel.
