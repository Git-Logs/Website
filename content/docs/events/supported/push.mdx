## Event Description

When a `push` event occurs, GitHub sends a payload containing detailed information about the push. This includes the commits that were pushed, the branch or tag that was updated, and the repository where the push occurred.

### Payload Example

Here is an example of the payload sent by GitHub for a `push` event:

```json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "before": "9049f1265b7d61be4a8904a9a27120d2064dab3b",
  "after": "b4a9f1265b7d61be4a8904a9a27120d2064dab3b",
  "repository": {
    "id": 12345678,
    "name": "example-repo",
    "full_name": "octocat/example-repo",
    "owner": {
      "name": "octocat",
      "email": "octocat@example.com"
    }
  },
  "pusher": {
    "name": "octocat",

  },
  "commits": [

      "author": {

## How Octohooks Handles the Push Event

Octohooks listens for `push` events and can be configured to perform various actions when this event is triggered. For example, you can set up Octohooks to post a message in a Discord channel whenever a push occurs in your repository.

### Example Configuration

To configure Octohooks to handle `push` events, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Webhook**: Use the `/newhook` command to create a new webhook in your Discord server.
2. **Set Up the Webhook in GitHub**: Add the webhook URL provided by Octohooks to your GitHub repository's webhook settings. Ensure that the `push` event is selected.
3. **Configure Event Modifiers**: Use the `/create` command to create an event modifier for the `push` event. This allows you to customize how the event is handled and displayed in your Discord channel.

### Example Command

```plaintext
/eventmod create webhook_id:12345 events:push blacklisted:false whitelisted:true priority:1 repo_id:67890 redirect_channel:#events
```

> In this example, the command creates an event modifier for the `push` event, ensuring that it is whitelisted and has a priority of 1. The event will be redirected to the `#events` channel in your Discord server.

### Additional Information
- Event Modifiers: Octohooks supports various event modifiers and filters, enabling you to fine-tune how push events are handled and displayed in your Discord channel.
- Troubleshooting: If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the push event, please refer to our support server for assistance.


By integrating the push event with Octohooks, you can automate notifications and streamline your workflow, ensuring your team stays informed about important repository activities.
