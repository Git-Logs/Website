## Event Description

When a `star` event occurs, GitHub sends a payload containing detailed information about the action. This includes whether the repository was starred or unstarred, the repository where the action occurred, and the user who performed the action.

### Payload Example

Here is an example of the payload sent by GitHub for a `star` event:

```json
{
  "action": "created",
  "repository": {
    "id": 12345678,
    "name": "example-repo",
    "full_name": "octocat/example-repo",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat/example-repo",
    "owner": {
      "login": "octocat",
      "id": 1,
      "avatar_url": "https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat"
    }
  },
  "sender": {
    "login": "octocat",
    "id": 1,
    "avatar_url": "https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat"
  }
}
```

## How Octohooks Handles the Star Event

Octohooks listens for `star` events and can be configured to perform various actions when this event is triggered. For example, you can set up Octohooks to post a message in a Discord channel whenever a repository is starred or unstarred.

### Example Configuration

To configure Octohooks to handle `star` events, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Webhook**: Use the `/newhook` command to create a new webhook in your Discord server.
2. **Set Up the Webhook in GitHub**: Add the webhook URL provided by Octohooks to your GitHub repository's webhook settings. Ensure that the `star` event is selected.
3. **Configure Event Modifiers**: Use the `/create` command to create an event modifier for the `star` event. This allows you to customize how the event is handled and displayed in your Discord channel.

### Example Command

```plaintext
/eventmod create webhook_id:12345 events:star blacklisted:false whitelisted:true priority:1 repo_id:67890 redirect_channel:#events
```

> In this example, the command creates an event modifier for the `star` event, ensuring that it is whitelisted and has a priority of 1. The event will be redirected to the `#events` channel in your Discord server.

### Additional Information

- **Event Modifiers**: Octohooks supports various event modifiers and filters, enabling you to fine-tune how star events are handled and displayed in your Discord channel.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the star event, please refer to our [support server](https://discord.gg/N4hnRmEJMX) for assistance.

By integrating the star event with Octohooks, you can automate notifications and streamline your workflow, ensuring your team stays informed about important repository activities.
