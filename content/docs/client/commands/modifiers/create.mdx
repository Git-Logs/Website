## Command Usage
> The `create` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/eventmod create` command, the bot will create a new event modifier for the specified webhook in the guild. If the guild or webhook does not exist in the database, appropriate messages will be displayed.

### Parameters

- **webhook_id**: The webhook ID.
- **events**: The events to match against, comma/space separated.
- **blacklisted**: Blacklist the events.
- **whitelisted**: Whitelist the events. Other events will not be allowed.
- **priority** (optional): Priority. Use 0 for normal priority.
- **repo_id** (optional): Repository ID, will match all if unset.
- **redirect_channel** (optional): Redirect channel ID.

### Example

```plaintext
/eventmod create webhook_id:12345 events:push,pull_request blacklisted:false whitelisted:true priority:1 repo_id:67890 redirect_channel:#events
```

> In this example, the command creates a new event modifier for the webhook with ID `12345`, matching `push` and `pull_request` events, whitelisting them, with a priority of `1`, for the repository with ID `67890`, and redirecting to the `#events` channel.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users create event modifiers in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command has a **guild cooldown** of 60 seconds to prevent spam.

- If the repository does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that the repository does not exist.
