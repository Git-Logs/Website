### Command Usage
> The `list` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/list` command, the bot will respond with a message listing all the webhooks in the guild. If there are no webhooks configured, it will prompt you to create a new webhook using the `/newhook` command.

### Parameters

This command does not require any parameters.

### Example

```plaintext
/list
```

> In this example, the command lists all webhooks configured in the current guild.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users view your active webhooks and their respective information.

### Cooldown
This command does not have a cooldown.

## Responses
When this command is triggered and the user/team has at least one webhook set up in their Discord server, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Webhook ID**    | The unique identifier for the webhook.                                      |
| **Hook URL**      | The URL to visit for hook information and to add to GitHub to receive events.|
| **Marked as Broken** | Indicates whether the webhook is marked as broken.                          |
| **Created at**    | The date and time when the webhook was created.                              |

## Notes
- If the guild does not exist in the database, the command will insert a new record for the guild and prompt the user to create a new webhook.
- If there are no webhooks configured in the guild, the command will prompt the user to create a new webhook using the `/newhook` or `git!newhook` command.
- The bot will provide a summary of all webhooks, including their status and creation date, to help you manage and monitor your webhooks effectively.
