### Command Usage
> The `resetsecret` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/resetsecret` command, the bot will reset the secret for the specified webhook in the guild and send the new secret to your DMs. If the guild or webhook does not exist in the database, appropriate messages will be displayed.

### Parameters

- **id**: The webhook ID (can be found using the `list` command).

### Example

```plaintext
/resetsecret id:12345
```

> In this example, the command resets the secret for the webhook with ID `12345`.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users reset webhook secrets in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command has a **guild cooldown** of 60 seconds to prevent spam.

## Responses
When this command is triggered, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Webhook ID**    | The unique identifier for the webhook.                                      |
| **New Secret**    | The new secret key for the webhook.                                         |
| **Status**        | Indicates whether the webhook secret was successfully reset.                |

## Notes
- If the guild does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that there are no webhooks in the guild.
- If the webhook does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that the webhook does not exist.
- The bot will send the new webhook secret to the user's DMs. Ensure that DMs are enabled from server members.
- The user must update the webhook information in GitHub settings with the new secret for the webhook to accept messages from GitHub.
- The bot will notify the user to delete the DM containing the new webhook secret after updating the webhook in GitHub for security purposes.
