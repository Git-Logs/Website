### Command Usage
> The `setrepochannel` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/setrepochannel` command, the bot will update the specified repository's channel in the guild. If the repository does not exist in the database, an appropriate message will be displayed.

### Parameters

- **id**: The repository ID (can be found using the `list` command).
- **channel**: The new channel ID.

### Example

```plaintext
/setrepochannel id:12345 channel:#new-channel
```

> In this example, the command updates the repository with ID `12345` to send notifications to the `#new-channel`.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users update repository channels in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command has a **guild cooldown** of 60 seconds to prevent spam.

## Responses
When this command is triggered, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Repository ID** | The unique identifier for the repository.                                   |
| **Channel ID**    | The ID of the new channel where notifications will be sent.                 |
| **Last Updated By** | The user who last updated the repository.                                  |

## Notes
- If the repository does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that the repository does not exist.
- The bot will update the repository's `last_updated_by` field to reflect the user who made the change.
- Ensure that the new channel ID is valid and that the bot has permission to send messages in the specified channel.
