### Command Usage
> The `newhook` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/newhook` command, the bot will create a new webhook in the guild and send the webhook credentials to your DMs. If the guild does not exist in the database, it will be created automatically.

### Parameters

- **comment**: The comment for the webhook.
- **broken** (optional): Indicates whether the webhook is broken.

### Example

```plaintext
/newhook comment:hi broken:false
```

> In this example, the command creates a new webhook with the comment "hi" and indicates that the webhook is not broken.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users create webhooks in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command has a **guild cooldown** of 60 seconds to prevent spam.

## Responses
When this command is triggered, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |

| **Webhook ID**    | The unique identifier for the webhook.                                      |
| **Hook URL**      | The URL to visit for hook information and to add to GitHub to receive events.|
| **Secret**        | The secret key to be used when setting up the webhook in GitHub.             |
| **Marked as Broken** | Indicates whether the webhook is marked as broken.                          |
| **Created at**    | The date and time when the webhook was created.                              |

## Notes
- If the guild does not exist in the database, the command will insert a new record for the guild.
- If there are no webhooks configured in the guild, the command will prompt the user to create a new webhook using the `/newhook` or `git!newhook` command.
- The bot will send the webhook credentials to the user's DMs. Ensure that DMs are enabled from server members.
- The webhook credentials include the webhook ID, hook URL, and secret key. These credentials are necessary for setting up the webhook in GitHub.
- The user must update the webhook information in GitHub settings with the provided hook URL and secret key for the webhook to accept messages from GitHub.
- The bot will notify the user to delete the DM containing the webhook credentials after setting up the webhook in GitHub for security purposes.
