### Command Usage
> The `newrepo` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/newrepo` command, the bot will create a new repository for the specified webhook in the guild. If the guild or webhook does not exist in the database, appropriate messages will be displayed.

### Parameters

- **webhook_id**: The webhook ID to use (can be found in the `list` command).
- **owner**: The repo owner or organization.
- **name**: The repo name.
- **channel**: The channel to send to.

### Example

```plaintext
/newrepo webhook_id:12345 owner:octocat name:my-repo channel:#general
```

> In this example, the command creates a new repository with the owner "octocat", repo name "my-repo", and sends notifications to the "#general" channel using the webhook with ID `12345`.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users create repositories in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command has a **guild cooldown** of 60 seconds to prevent spam.
