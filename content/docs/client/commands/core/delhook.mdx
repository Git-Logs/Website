### Command Usage
> The `delhook` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/delhook` command, the bot will delete the specified webhook in the guild. If the guild or webhook does not exist in the database, appropriate messages will be displayed.

### Parameters

- **id**: The webhook ID (can be found using the `list` command).

### Example

```plaintext
/delhook id:12345
```

> In this example, the command deletes the webhook with ID `12345`.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users delete webhooks in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command has a **guild cooldown** of 60 seconds to prevent spam.

## Responses
When this command is triggered, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |

| **Status**        | Indicates whether the webhook was successfully deleted.                     |

## Notes
- If the guild does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that there are no webhooks in the guild.
