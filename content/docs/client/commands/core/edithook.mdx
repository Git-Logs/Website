# Edit Webhook

The `edithook` command allows you to edit an existing webhook in a guild for sending GitHub notifications. This command is useful for updating the webhook's comment, status, or secret.

## Command Details

### Command Usage
> The `edithook` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/edithook` command, the bot will update the specified webhook in the guild with the provided parameters. If the guild or webhook does not exist in the database, appropriate messages will be displayed.

### Parameters

- **id**: The webhook ID (can be found using the `list` command).
- **comment** (optional): The comment for the webhook.
- **broken** (optional): Indicates whether the webhook is broken.
- **webhook_secret** (optional): The new secret for the webhook.

### Example

```plaintext
/edithook id:12345 comment:"Updated comment" broken:false webhook_secret:"newsecret"
```

> In this example, the command updates the webhook with ID `12345`, sets the comment to "Updated comment", marks the webhook as not broken, and updates the secret to "newsecret".

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users edit webhooks in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command has a **guild cooldown** of 60 seconds to prevent spam.

## Responses
When this command is triggered, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |

| **Last Updated By** | The user who last updated the webhook.                                      |

## Notes
- If the guild does not exist in the database, the command will insert a new record for the guild.
- If the webhook does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that the webhook does not exist.
- The bot will update the webhook's `last_updated_at` and `last_updated_by` fields regardless of which parameters are provided.
- Ensure that the new secret is updated in GitHub settings to maintain the webhook's functionality.
