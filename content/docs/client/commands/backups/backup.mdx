### Command Usage
> The `backup` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/backup` command, the bot will create a JSON file containing the backup data and send it to you as an attachment.

### Parameters

- **id**: The webhook ID (can be found using the `list` command).

### Example

```plaintext
/backup id:12345
```

> In this example, the command creates a backup for the webhook with ID `12345`.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users create backups in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command does not have a cooldown.

## Responses
When this command is triggered, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backup File**   | A JSON file containing the backup data for the specified webhook.            |

## Notes
- If the guild does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that there are no webhooks in the guild.
- If the webhook does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that the webhook does not exist.
- The backup file will include information about repositories and event modifiers associated with the specified webhook.
- Ensure that you save the backup file securely, as it contains sensitive information about your webhook configuration.
- The backup file can be used to restore the configuration at a later time using the `/restore` command.
