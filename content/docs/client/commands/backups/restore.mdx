### Command Usage
> The `restore` command is available as both a slash command and a prefixed command using the prefix `git!`

When you run the `/restore` command, the bot will restore the backup data from the provided JSON file to the specified webhook.

### Parameters

- **id**: The webhook ID to restore the backup to.
- **file**: The backup file (must be a JSON file created using the `backup` command).

### Example

```plaintext
/restore id:12345 file:backup.json
```

> In this example, the command restores the backup from `backup.json` to the webhook with ID `12345`.

### Permissions
This command **requires** the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to execute. This is for security purposes to avoid letting unauthorized users restore backups in your guild.

### Cooldown
This command does not have a cooldown.

## Responses
When this command is triggered, the bot will respond with the following data:

| Field             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Status**        | Indicates the progress and completion of the restore process.               |

## Notes
- If the guild does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that there are no webhooks in the guild.
- If the webhook does not exist in the database, the command will notify the user that the webhook does not exist.
- The backup file must be compatible with the current version of the bot. If the protocol version does not match, the command will notify the user.
- Ensure that the backup file is valid and has not been tampered with to avoid issues during the restore process.
- The restore process will update existing repositories and event modifiers or create new ones if they do not exist.
- The bot will provide a summary of the restore process, including the number of repositories and event modifiers inserted or updated.
