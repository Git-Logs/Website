We understand that our bot can be intimidating for new comers and want to help make your setup and usage as seamless as possible,
below is a detailed list of setup instructions to help get you started.

  <Tab value="Invite the Bot">
     ## Getting Started
 Inviting the bot is easy and hassle free, just follow the steps below!
<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Visit our Website
    Head over to [gitlogs.xyz/invite](https://gitlogs.xyz/invite) to start the process of inviting the bot to your server, this link will loop you through Discord's authorization process.
  </Step>
  <Step> 
    ### Choose a Server
    Choose the server you would like to add the bot too from the `ADD TO SERVER` dropdown menu, then click the `Continue` button.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Select Permissions
      <Callout title="Important Info" type="warn">
        We highly recommend that you leave all the default permissions enabled to ensure no issues with the functionality of Git Logs
      </Callout>
      By default Git Logs uses a set list of permissions, you can configure permissions as you wish prior to continuing with the invite process.

  </Step>
</Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Create a Webhook">
     ## Creating a Webhook
     Before you can start listening to events you will need to create a new webhook, to do this you will need to ensure the bot and yourself have the `Use Application Commands` permissions and then run the `/newhook` command
![newhook command](/samples/repo/newhook-cmd.png)

Once the webhook is generated the bot will send you a Direct Message that looks something like this:
![webhook message](/samples/repo/webhook-dm.png)

This direct message will contain all the information you need to continue to the `Using a Webhook` tab, the information you will need is:
  - Webhook URL (located at the top of the message)
  - Webhook Secret (Located in the second paragraph "`Set the Secret field to`")
  - Content Type (will always be `application/json`)
  - Webhook ID (Located in the third paragraph "`When creating repositories use`")
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Use your Webhook">
     ## Using your Webhook(s)
     To setup webhook events for your GitHub Repository or Organization please follow the steps below, 
You will first need to create a webhook and payload url using Git Logs. See [here](/docs/setup/create-webhook) for details.
    
<Callout title="Important Info" type="info">
  Webhooks can be setup for either a Repository or an Organization, adding webhooks to an organization is more seamless in most cases. 
  We recommend setting them up for the entire org when and where possible! Steps are the same for both
</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step> 
### Navigate to your Repository/Organization
Go to the GitHub repository or organization where you want to set up the webhook.
</Step>

<Step>
### Open the Repository Settings
Click on the "Settings" tab in the repository menu 
![repo-settings](/samples/repo/settings.png)

</Step>

<Step>
### Open Webhook Settings
Select the "Webhooks" tab from the left sidebar of the settings page and then click on the `Add webhook` button.
![add-hook](/samples/repo/add-hook.png)
</Step>

<Step>
### Add your Webhook
In the `Add webhook` page/tab you want to fill out the form with the information provided to you by Git Logs,
here is an example of the required information:

- Payload URL: `https://v2.gitlogs.xyz/kittycat?id=WEBHOOK_ID`
- Content type: `application/json` (this will never change)
- Secret: should match the secret provided to you by Git Logs
- SSL verification: you can enable or disable this as you see fit
- Which events: this option is also entirely up to you, if you choose send me everything we can blacklist events you don't want to see

</Step>

<Step>
### Monitor your Repo

and allow you to monitor webhook events such as `Pull Requests`, `Deployments` and more. The command params should be filled out like so:
