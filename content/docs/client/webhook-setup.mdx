  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Receive Webhook Information
    Once the webhook is generated, the bot will send you a Direct Message that looks something like this:
    ![webhook message](/samples/repo/webhook-dm.png)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 4: Note Down Webhook Details
    This direct message will contain all the information you need to continue to the `Using a Webhook` section. The information you will need is:
    - Webhook URL (located at the top of the message)
    - Webhook Secret (Located in the second paragraph "`Set the Secret field to`")
    - Content Type (will always be `application/json`)
    - Webhook ID (Located in the third paragraph "`When creating repositories use`")
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Information

- **Permissions**: Ensure that both you and the bot have the necessary permissions to create and manage webhooks.
- **Direct Messages**: Make sure your DMs are open to receive the webhook information from the bot.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any issues during the webhook creation process, please refer to our [support server](https://discord.gg/N4hnRmEJMX) for assistance.

By following these steps, you will successfully create a webhook using the Git Logs bot, allowing you to start receiving GitHub notifications in your Discord server.
