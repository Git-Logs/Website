<Callout title="Important Info" type="info">
  Webhooks can be set up for either a Repository or an Organization. Adding webhooks to an organization is more seamless in most cases. 
  We recommend setting them up for the entire org when and where possible! Steps are the same for both.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Navigate to your Repository/Organization
    Go to the GitHub repository or organization where you want to set up the webhook.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 4: Add your Webhook
    In the `Add webhook` page/tab, you want to fill out the form with the information provided to you by Git Logs. Here is an example of the required information:
    - Payload URL: `https://v2.gitlogs.xyz/kittycat?id=WEBHOOK_ID`
    - Content type: `application/json` (this will never change)
    - Secret: should match the secret provided to you by Git Logs
    - SSL verification: you can enable or disable this as you see fit
    - Which events: this option is also entirely up to you. If you choose "send me everything," we can blacklist events you don't want to see.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 5: Monitor your Repo
    Once you have completed all the steps above, you are ready to run the `/newrepo` command in the bot. This command will link your repository to your webhook and allow you to monitor webhook events such as `Pull Requests`, `Deployments`, and more. The command params should be filled out like so:

    #### Command Params
    <TypeTable
      type={{
        webhook_id: {
          description: 'Your Webhook ID',
          type: 'string',
        },
        owner: {
          description: 'Your GitHub User/Org Name',
          type: 'string'
        },
        name: {
          description: 'Your GitHub Repository Name',
          type: 'string'
        },
        channel: {
          description: 'The Discord Channel to send event logs to',
          type: 'string'
        }
      }}
    />

    #### Param Details
    - `webhook_id`: your webhook ID provided to you by Git Logs 
    - `owner`: your GitHub user/organization name (ex: Git-Logs)
